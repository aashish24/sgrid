SGRID: Conventions for Staggered Grids
=================
Note: NetCDF files using this convention can be be given the global attribute `Conventions = 'CF-1.6, SGRID-0.1'` if they are CF- and SGRID-compliant, or just `Conventions = 'SGRID-0.1'` if they are not CF-compliant. 
* [Version 0.1.0 ](https://github.com/sgrid/sgrid/blob/v0.1.0/src/index.md)
